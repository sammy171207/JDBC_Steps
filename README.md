### JDBC 5-Step Guide

1. **Installation**: Ensure JDK is installed. Download and add the JDBC driver for your database to your project's classpath.

2. **Connecting to the Database**: Use `DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password)` to establish a connection.

3. **Executing Queries**: Use `Statement` or `PreparedStatement` to execute SQL queries and process `ResultSet`.

4. **Handling Transactions**: Use `connection.setAutoCommit(false)` to start a transaction, execute SQL statements, then commit or rollback as needed.

5. **Closing Resources**: Always close JDBC resources (`Connection`, `Statement`, `ResultSet`) using `close()` to release database and JDBC resources.

This concise guide provides the essential steps to use JDBC effectively in your Java projects. For detailed information and advanced usage, refer to JDBC documentation and database-specific resources.
